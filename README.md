# LibraryManagementSystem
CS-151 Final Project
Jerry Sun

To run this program compile with javac *.java
The main file is LibraryManagementSystem.java so run with java LibraryManagementSystem

user.dat saves the information of users into file, although not very readable

Was not able to implement some features fully, for example making the custom exceptions as
good as possible.

DatabaseAdministrator.java is not necessary since librarian already fulfills all the capabilities

-if I had more time I would make the interface better looking, for library and RegularUserPanel the interface
is a little inconsistent compared to the welcome and signup page.

-also signup page allows a user with single characters for their first and last name to sign up which is not ideal

- could make the interface look better as well. Does not look beautiful, even the signup and welcome page.
